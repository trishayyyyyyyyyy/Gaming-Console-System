# 🎮 Java Gaming Console Simulation – Lab 8

This project simulates a gaming console system using Java. It applies object-oriented principles to model and manage various console operations via well-structured classes.

## 📁 Files Included

- `GamingConsole.java` – Represents the base interface or class for a gaming console.
- `ConsoleActions.java` – Contains implementations of actions available on the console.
- `ConsoleManager.java` – Manages console behavior and coordinates actions.
- `Main.java` – Entry point for running the simulation.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Interface or abstract class design
- Object-oriented encapsulation and abstraction
- Method delegation and modular structure

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (CLI-based)
- Object-Oriented Programming
